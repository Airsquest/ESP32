TFT LCD Pin to	ESP32 Pin	Description

LCD_RST	-> GPIO 22	Reset signal, low level reset
LCD_CS	-> GPIO 5	Chip Select, low level enable
LCD_RS (DC)	-> GPIO 21	Command/Data selection (Low = Command, High = Data)
LCD_WR (MOSI)	-> GPIO 23	Write signal (SPI MOSI)
LCD_RD (MISO)	-> GPIO 19	Read signal (SPI MISO, if used)
GND	-> GND	Power ground
3V3	-> 3.3V	Power input for TFT
//5V Not connected (ESP32 uses 3.3V)
